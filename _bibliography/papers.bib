              development and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
              however, whether this protein is limiting for HSC development is
              unknown due to lack of physiologic model systems. Here, we
              develop an MLL1-inducible embryonic stem cell (ESC) system and
              show that induction of wild-type MLL1 during ESC differentiation
              selectively increases hematopoietic potential from a transitional
              c-Kit+/Cd41+ population in the embryoid body and also at sites of
              hematopoiesis in embryos. Single-cell sequencing analysis
              illustrates inherent heterogeneity of the c-Kit+/Cd41+ population
              and demonstrates that MLL1 induction shifts its composition
              toward multilineage hematopoietic identities. Surprisingly, this
              does not occur through increasing Hox or other canonical MLL1
              targets but through an enhanced Rac/Rho/integrin signaling state,
              which increases responsiveness to Vla4 ligands and enhances

              enhance the genome integrity and annotation of a model
              hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel. Our new assembly brings
              this genome to near chromosome-level contiguity and adds
              thousands of previously unannotated genes. These new genomic
              resources were used to identify 6,505 hibernation-related,
              differentially-expressed and processed transcripts using RNA-seq
              data from three brain regions in animals whose physiological
              status was precisely defined using body temperature telemetry. A
              software tool, squirrelBox, was developed to foster further data
              analyses and visualization. SquirrelBox includes a comprehensive
              toolset for rapid visualization of gene level and cluster group
              dynamics, sequence scanning of k-mer and domains, and interactive
              exploration of gene lists. Using these new tools and data, we
              deconvolute seasonal from temperature-dependent effects on the
              brain transcriptome during hibernation for the first time,
              highlighting the importance of carefully timed samples for
              studies of differential gene expression in hibernation. The

              composition of the RNA pool. In addition to passive effects of
              temperature, we provide evidence for regulated transcription and
              RNA turnover during hibernation. Significant alternative
              splicing, largely temperature dependent, also occurs during
              hibernation. These findings form a crucial first step and provide
              a roadmap for future work toward defining novel mechanisms of

              which neoplastic cells and associated immune cells contribute to
              disease progression. We aimed to determine the influence of
              neoplastic and immune cell diversity on MB biology in patient
              samples and animal models. METHODS: To better characterize
              cellular heterogeneity in MB we used single-cell RNA sequencing,
              immunohistochemistry and deconvolution of transcriptomic data to
              profile neoplastic and immune populations in patient samples and
              animal models across childhood MB subgroups. RESULTS: Neoplastic
              cells cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin
              which is influenced by chromosomal copy number variance. Harmony
              alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated
              subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes,
              including photoreceptor and glutamatergic neuron-like cells in
              molecular subgroups GP3 and GP4, and a specific nodule-associated
              neuronally-differentiated subpopulation in subgroup molecular
              SHH. We definitively chart the spectrum of MB immune cell
              infiltrates, which include subpopulations that recapitulate
              developmentally-related neuron-pruning and antigen presenting
              myeloid cells. MB cellular diversity matching human samples is
              mirrored in subgroup-specific mouse models of MB. CONCLUSIONS:
              These findings provide a clearer understanding of the diverse

              however, the physiologic RNA substrates of EndoU are unknown. In
              this study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected bone
              marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) and cyclic phosphate cDNA
              sequencing to identify the RNA targets of EndoU. EndoU targeted
              viral RNA, cleaving the 3' side of pyrimidines with a strong
              preference for U  A and C  A sequences (endoY  A).
              EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA,
              from the 5' NTR to the 3' NTR, including transcriptional
              regulatory sequences (TRS). Cleavage at two CA dinucleotides
              immediately adjacent to the MHV poly(A) tail suggests a mechanism
              to suppress negative-strand RNA synthesis and the accumulation of
              viral dsRNA. MHV with EndoU (EndoUmut) or 2'-5' phosphodiesterase
              (PDEmut) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM,
              with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L. The physiologic
              targets of EndoU are viral RNA templates required for
              negative-strand RNA synthesis and dsRNA accumulation. Coronavirus

  author   = "Hesselberth, Jay R",
  abstract = "After transcription of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA, its introns are
              removed by the spliceosome, joining exons for translation. The
              intron products of splicing have long been considered 'junk' and
              destined only for destruction. But because they are large in size
              and under weak selection constraints, many introns have been
              evolutionarily repurposed to serve roles after splicing. Some
              spliced introns are precursors for further processing of other
              encoded RNAs such as small nucleolar RNAs, microRNAs, and long
              noncoding RNAs. Other intron products have long half-lives and
              can be exported to the cytoplasm, suggesting that they have roles
              in translation. Some viruses encode introns that accumulate after
              splicing and play important but mysterious roles in viral
              latency. Turnover of most lariat-introns is initiated by cleavage
              of their internal 2'-5' phosphodiester bonds by a unique
              debranching endonuclease, and the linear products are further
              degraded by exoribonucleases. However, several introns appear to
              evade this turnover pathway and the determinants of their
              stability are largely unknown. Whereas many stable intron
              products were discovered serendipitously, new experimental and
              computational tools will enable their direct identification and
              study. Finally, the origins and mechanisms of mobility of
              eukaryotic introns are mysterious, and mechanistic studies of the
              intron life cycle may yield new insights into how they arose and
              became widespread.",

              homology to Dbr1 but lacks essential active site residues found
              in Dbr1. Whereas loss of Dbr1 results in lariat-introns failing
              broadly to turnover, loss of Drn1 causes low levels of
              lariat-intron accumulation. Conserved residues in the Drn1
              C-terminal CwfJ domains, which are not present in Dbr1, are

              debranching catalyzed by Dbr1 in vitro, but does so without
              significantly improving the affinity of Dbr1 for branched RNA.
              Splicing carried out in in vitro extracts in the absence of Drn1
              results in an accumulation of branched splicing intermediates and

              debranching, as well as the promiscuous release of cleaved
              5'-exon. Drn1 enhances Dbr1-mediated turnover of
              lariat-intermediates and lariat-intron products, indicating that

              However, current ligation-based RNA capture methods require RNA
              substrates with terminal 3'-hydroxyl groups, limiting their
              utility for identifying RNAs with modified termini like
              2',3'-cyclic phosphates. Cyclic phosphate-terminated RNAs are
              generated by endonucleolytic cleavages and self-cleaving
              ribozymes and are found as stable modifications on cellular RNAs
              such as the U6 spliceosomal RNA. We developed a method that uses

              phosphates. The adaptor allows specific priming by reverse

              azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is
              superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these
              promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis
              of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax +
              azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
              cycle manifested by decreased $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and
              increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron
              transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed
              inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of
              succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress
              oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and

              genomic method used by our laboratory to localize Cdc7 to regions
              of chromosomes. Originally, mutations in the CDC7 gene were found
              in the classic cdc mutant collection of Hartwell et al. (Genetics
              74:267-286, 1973). The CDC7 gene was found to encode a protein
              kinase called DDK that has been studied for many years,
              establishing its precise role in the initiation of DNA
              replication at origins. Recently, clinical studies are underway
              with DDK inhibitors against DDK in cancer patients. However, the
              conundrum is that Cdc7 has never been detected at origins of
              replication even though many studies have suggested it should be
              there. We used ``Calling Card'' system in which DNA binding
              proteins are localized to the genome via retrotransposon
              insertion and deep-sequencing methods. We have shown that Cdc7
              localizes at many regions of the genome and was enriched at
              functional origins of replication. These results are consistent
              with DDK's role in many additional genomic processes including
              mutagenesis, chromatid cohesion, and meiotic recombination. Thus,
              the main conclusion from our studies is that Cdc7 kinase is found
              at many locations in the genome, but is enriched at functional
              origins of replication. Furthermore, we propose that application

              synaptic activity in specific brain regions, the enhancer-trap
              driver line E347 elevated fat upon neuronal silencing, and
              decreased fat upon neuronal activation. Unbiased sequencing
              revealed that Arc1 mRNA levels increase upon E347 activation. We

              Here we reveal metabolic changes in Arc1 mutants consistent with
              a high-fat phenotype and an overall shift toward energy storage.
              We find that Arc1-expressing cells neighbor E347 neurons, and

              regulatory subunit, Dbf4, and a catalytic subunit, Cdc7, is
              essential for DNA replication initiation during S phase of the
              cell cycle through MCM2-7 helicase phosphorylation. The
              biological significance of DDK is well characterized, but the
              full mechanism of how DDK associates with substrates remains
              unclear. Cdc7 is bound to chromatin in the Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae genome throughout the cell cycle, but there is little
              empirical evidence as to specific Cdc7 binding locations. Using
              biochemical and genetic techniques, this study investigated the
              specific localization of Cdc7 on chromatin. The Calling Cards
              method, using Ty5 retrotransposons as a marker for DNA-protein
              binding, suggests Cdc7 kinase is preferentially bound to genomic
              DNA known to replicate early in S phase, including centromeres
              and origins of replication. We also discovered Cdc7 binding
              throughout the genome, which may be necessary to initiate other
              cellular processes, including meiotic recombination and
              translesion synthesis. A kinase dead Cdc7 point mutation
              increases the Ty5 retrotransposon integration efficiency and a
              55-amino acid C-terminal truncation of Cdc7, unable to bind Dbf4,
              reduces Cdc7 binding suggesting a requirement for Dbf4 to
              stabilize Cdc7 on chromatin during S phase. Chromatin
              immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Cdc7 binding near specific
              origins changes during S phase. Our results suggest a model where
              Cdc7 is loosely bound to chromatin during G1 At the G1/S

              azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is
              superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these
              promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis
              of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax +
              azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
              cycle manifested by decreased $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and
              increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron
              transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed
              inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of
              succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress
              oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and
              selectively targets LSCs. Our findings show for the first time
              that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients
              with AML by disrupting the metabolic machinery driving energy
              metabolism, resulting in promising clinical activity in a patient

              crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) allows for high
              resolution, genome-wide mapping of RNA-binding proteins. This
              methodology is frequently used to validate predicted targets of
              microRNA binding, as well as direct targets of other RNA-binding
              proteins. Hence, the accuracy and sensitivity of binding site
              identification is critical. RESULTS: We found that substantial
              mispriming during reverse transcription results in the
              overrepresentation of sequences complementary to the primer used
              for reverse transcription. Up to 45 \% of peaks in publicly
              available HITS-CLIP libraries are attributable to this mispriming
              artifact, and the majority of libraries have detectable levels of
              mispriming. We also found that standard techniques for validating
              microRNA-target interactions fail to differentiate between
              artifactual peaks and physiologically relevant peaks.
              CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present a modification to the HITS-CLIP

              resemblance to the normal RTA substrate, the sarcin-ricin loop

              RTA (K(d) = 7.3 nM) which could compete directly with the SRL for

               expand the complexity of the transcriptome. In ectothermic
               organisms, including Drosophila and Cephalopoda, where body
               temperature mirrors ambient temperature, decreases in
               environmental temperature lead to increases in A-to-I RNA
               editing and cause amino acid recoding events that are thought to
               be adaptive responses to temperature fluctuations. In contrast,
               endothermic mammals, including humans and mice, typically
               maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental
               changes. Here, A-to-I editing primarily targets repeat elements,
               rarely results in the recoding of amino acids, and plays a
               critical role in innate immune tolerance. Hibernating ground
               squirrels provide a unique opportunity to examine RNA editing in
               a heterothermic mammal whose body temperature varies over 30C
               and can be maintained at 5C for many days during torpor. We
               profiled the transcriptome in three brain regions at six
               physiological states to quantify RNA editing and determine
               whether cold-induced RNA editing modifies the transcriptome as a
               potential mechanism for neuroprotection at low temperature
               during hibernation. We identified 5165 A-to-I editing sites in
               1205 genes with dynamically increased editing after prolonged
               cold exposure. The majority (99.6\%) of the cold-increased
               editing sites are outside of previously annotated coding
               regions, 82.7\% lie in SINE-derived repeats, and 12 sites are
               predicted to recode amino acids. Additionally, A-to-I editing
               frequencies increase with increasing cold-exposure,
               demonstrating that ADAR remains active during torpor. Our
               findings suggest that dynamic A-to-I editing at low body

  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are influenced by
               type 1 interferon-mediated antiviral defenses and by viral
               countermeasures to these defenses. When IAV NS1 protein is
               disabled, RNase L restricts virus replication; however, the RNAs
               targeted for cleavage by RNase L under these conditions have not
               been defined. In this study, we used deep-sequencing methods to
               identify RNase L cleavage sites within host and viral RNAs from
               IAV PR8$\Delta$NS1-infected A549 cells. Short hairpin RNA
               knockdown of RNase L allowed us to distinguish between RNase
               L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites. RNase
               L-dependent cleavage sites were evident at discrete locations in
               IAV RNA segments (both positive and negative strands). Cleavage
               in PB2, PB1, and PA genomic RNAs suggests that viral RNPs are
               susceptible to cleavage by RNase L. Prominent amounts of
               cleavage mapped to specific regions within IAV RNAs, including
               some areas of increased synonymous-site conservation. Among
               cellular RNAs, RNase L-dependent cleavage was most frequent at
               precise locations in rRNAs. Our data show that RNase L targets
               specific sites in both host and viral RNAs to restrict influenza
               virus replication when NS1 protein is disabled. IMPORTANCE:
               RNase L is a critical component of interferon-regulated and
               double-stranded-RNA-activated antiviral host responses. We
               sought to determine how RNase L exerts its antiviral activity
               during influenza virus infection. We enhanced the antiviral
               activity of RNase L by disabling a viral protein, NS1, that
               inhibits the activation of RNase L. Then, using deep-sequencing
               methods, we identified the host and viral RNAs targeted by RNase
               L. We found that RNase L cleaved viral RNAs and rRNAs at very
               precise locations. The direct cleavage of IAV RNAs by RNase L
               highlights an intimate battle between viral RNAs and an
               antiviral endonuclease.",

               in adults. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) drive the initiation and
               perpetuation of AML, are quantifiably associated with worse
               clinical outcomes, and often persist after conventional
               chemotherapy resulting in relapse1-5. In this report, we show
               that treatment of older patients with AML with the B cell
               lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in combination with
               azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is
               superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these
               promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis
               of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax +
               azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)

               oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and

               that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients

              that lack RtcB have defects that are independent of tRNA
              maturation and the unfolded protein response. Thus, RNA ligation
              by RtcB is required for the function of multiple endogenous
              target RNAs including both xbp-1 and tRNAs. RtcB is uniquely
              capable of performing these ligation functions, and RNA ligation
              by RtcB mediates multiple essential processes in vivo.",
