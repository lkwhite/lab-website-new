      <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented
              view of cellular diversity of biological systems. However, across
              the thousands of publications and datasets generated using this
              technology, we estimate that only a minority (&lt;25\%) of studies
              provide cell-level metadata information containing identified
              cell types and related findings of the published dataset.
              Metadata omission hinders reproduction, exploration, validation,
              and knowledge transfer and is a common problem across journals,
              data repositories, and publication dates. We encourage
              investigators, reviewers, journals, and data repositories to
              improve their standards and ensure proper documentation of these
              valuable datasets.</p>

      <p>BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma (MB) is a heterogeneous disease in
              which neoplastic cells and associated immune cells contribute to
              disease progression. We aimed to determine the influence of
              neoplastic and immune cell diversity on MB biology in patient
              samples and animal models. METHODS: To better characterize
              cellular heterogeneity in MB we used single-cell RNA sequencing,
              immunohistochemistry and deconvolution of transcriptomic data to
              profile neoplastic and immune populations in patient samples and
              animal models across childhood MB subgroups. RESULTS: Neoplastic
              cells cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin
              which is influenced by chromosomal copy number variance. Harmony
              alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated
              subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes,
              including photoreceptor and glutamatergic neuron-like cells in
              molecular subgroups GP3 and GP4, and a specific nodule-associated
              neuronally-differentiated subpopulation in subgroup molecular
              SHH. We definitively chart the spectrum of MB immune cell
              infiltrates, which include subpopulations that recapitulate
              developmentally-related neuron-pruning and antigen presenting
              myeloid cells. MB cellular diversity matching human samples is
              mirrored in subgroup-specific mouse models of MB. CONCLUSIONS:
              These findings provide a clearer understanding of the diverse
              neoplastic and immune cell subpopulations that constitute the MB
              microenvironment.</p>

      <p>The detection of foreign antigens in vivo has relied on
               fluorescent conjugation or indirect read-outs such as antigen
               presentation. In our studies, we found that these widely used
               techniques had several technical limitations that have precluded
               a complete picture of antigen trafficking or retention across
               lymph node cell types. To address these limitations, we
               developed a 'molecular tracking device' to follow the
               distribution, acquisition, and retention of antigen in the lymph
               node. Utilizing an antigen conjugated to a nuclease-resistant
               DNA tag, acting as a combined antigen-adjuvant conjugate, and
               single-cell mRNA sequencing, we quantified antigen abundance in
               the lymph node. Variable antigen levels enabled the
               identification of caveolar endocytosis as a mechanism of antigen
               acquisition or retention in lymphatic endothelial cells. Thus,
               these molecular tracking devices enable new approaches to study
               dynamic tissue dissemination of antigen-adjuvant conjugates and

      <p>The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL1, KMT2A) gene is critical for
              development and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
              however, whether this protein is limiting for HSC development is
              unknown due to lack of physiologic model systems. Here, we
              develop an MLL1-inducible embryonic stem cell (ESC) system and
              show that induction of wild-type MLL1 during ESC differentiation
              selectively increases hematopoietic potential from a transitional
              c-Kit+/Cd41+ population in the embryoid body and also at sites of
              hematopoiesis in embryos. Single-cell sequencing analysis
              illustrates inherent heterogeneity of the c-Kit+/Cd41+ population
              and demonstrates that MLL1 induction shifts its composition
              toward multilineage hematopoietic identities. Surprisingly, this
              does not occur through increasing Hox or other canonical MLL1
              targets but through an enhanced Rac/Rho/integrin signaling state,
              which increases responsiveness to Vla4 ligands and enhances
              hematopoietic commitment. Together, our data implicate a
              Rac/Rho/integrin signaling axis in the endothelial to
              hematopoietic transition and demonstrate that MLL1 actives this
              axis.</p>

      <p>Hibernation is a physiological and behavioral phenotype that
              minimizes energy expenditure. Hibernators cycle between profound
              depression and rapid hyperactivation of multiple physiological
              processes, challenging our concept of mammalian homeostasis. How
              the hibernator orchestrates and survives these extremes while
              maintaining cell to organismal viability is unknown. Here, we
              enhance the genome integrity and annotation of a model
              hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel. Our new assembly brings
              this genome to near chromosome-level contiguity and adds
              thousands of previously unannotated genes. These new genomic
              resources were used to identify 6,505 hibernation-related,
              differentially-expressed and processed transcripts using RNA-seq
              data from three brain regions in animals whose physiological
              status was precisely defined using body temperature telemetry. A
              software tool, squirrelBox, was developed to foster further data
              analyses and visualization. SquirrelBox includes a comprehensive
              toolset for rapid visualization of gene level and cluster group
              dynamics, sequence scanning of k-mer and domains, and interactive
              exploration of gene lists. Using these new tools and data, we
              deconvolute seasonal from temperature-dependent effects on the
              brain transcriptome during hibernation for the first time,
              highlighting the importance of carefully timed samples for
              studies of differential gene expression in hibernation. The
              identified genes include a regulatory network of RNA binding
              proteins that are dynamic in hibernation along with the
              composition of the RNA pool. In addition to passive effects of
              temperature, we provide evidence for regulated transcription and
              RNA turnover during hibernation. Significant alternative
              splicing, largely temperature dependent, also occurs during
              hibernation. These findings form a crucial first step and provide
              a roadmap for future work toward defining novel mechanisms of
              tissue protection and metabolic depression that may 1 day be
              applied toward improving human health.</p>

              (scRNA-seq) data remains a time-consuming and error-prone
              process. Current packages for identity assignment use limited
              types of reference data and often have rigid data structure
              requirements. We developed the clustifyr R package to leverage
              several external data types, including gene expression profiles
              to assign likely cell types using data from scRNA-seq, bulk
              RNA-seq, microarray expression data, or signature gene lists. We
              benchmark various parameters of a correlation-based approach and
              implement gene list enrichment methods. clustifyr is a
              lightweight and effective cell-type assignment tool developed for
              compatibility with various scRNA-seq analysis workflows.
              clustifyr is publicly available at
              https://github.com/rnabioco/clustifyr.</p>

      <p>Coronavirus EndoU inhibits dsRNA-activated antiviral responses;
              however, the physiologic RNA substrates of EndoU are unknown. In
              this study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected bone
              marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) and cyclic phosphate cDNA
              sequencing to identify the RNA targets of EndoU. EndoU targeted
              viral RNA, cleaving the 3' side of pyrimidines with a strong
              preference for U  A and C  A sequences (endoY  A).
              EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA,
              from the 5' NTR to the 3' NTR, including transcriptional
              regulatory sequences (TRS). Cleavage at two CA dinucleotides
              immediately adjacent to the MHV poly(A) tail suggests a mechanism
              to suppress negative-strand RNA synthesis and the accumulation of
              viral dsRNA. MHV with EndoU (EndoUmut) or 2'-5' phosphodiesterase
              (PDEmut) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM,
              with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L. The physiologic
              targets of EndoU are viral RNA templates required for
              negative-strand RNA synthesis and dsRNA accumulation. Coronavirus
              EndoU cleaves U  A and C  A sequences (endoY  A) within viral
              (+) strand RNA to evade dsRNA-activated host responses.</p>

      <p>Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in
              childhood that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral
              cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples significantly
              confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development
              of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA
              sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular
              heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of
              PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated
              progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into
              subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions
              into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals
              that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in
              peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification
              paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to
              determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an
              interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the
              EPN single-cell dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity
              increases understanding of EPN biology.</p>

      <p>Structured RNA elements that protect RNA transcripts from
              5'$\rightarrow$3' degradation are becoming useful research tools.
              Here we show that exonuclease-resistant RNA structures (xrRNAs)
              from Flaviviruses can be used to protect heterologous messenger
              RNAs (mRNAs) from 5'$\rightarrow$3' degradation in budding yeast.
              Installation of xrRNAs ahead of a downstream internal ribosome
              entry site (IRES) leads to the accumulation of partially-degraded
              mRNAs that are substrates for cap-independent translation of a
              LacZ reporter, yielding a 30-fold increase in measured
              $\beta$-galactosidase activity. Additionally, by monitoring the
              translation of dual-luciferase reporters we show that xrRNA
              sequences do not interfere with the progression of an elongating
              ribosome. Combined these data indicate that xrRNA elements can be
              used in creative ways to stabilize RNAs with potentially useful
              applications. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement AM, JSK, JRH

      <p>Liver lymphatic vessels support liver function by draining
               interstitial fluid, cholesterol, fat, and immune cells for
               surveillance in the liver draining lymph node. Chronic liver
               disease is associated with increased inflammation and immune
               cell infiltrate. However, it is currently unknown if or how
               lymphatic vessels respond to increased inflammation and immune
               cell infiltrate in the liver during chronic disease. Here we
               demonstrate that lymphatic vessel abundance increases in
               patients with chronic liver disease and is associated with areas
               of fibrosis and immune cell infiltration. Using single-cell mRNA
               sequencing and multi-spectral immunofluorescence analysis we
               identified liver lymphatic endothelial cells and found that
               chronic liver disease results in lymphatic endothelial cells
               (LECs) that are in active cell cycle with increased expression
               of CCL21. Additionally, we found that LECs from patients with
               NASH adopt a transcriptional program associated with increased
               IL13 signaling. Moreover, we found that oxidized low density
               lipoprotein, associated with NASH pathogenesis, induced the
               transcription and protein production of IL13 in LECs both in
               vitro and in a mouse model. Finally, we show that oxidized low
               density lipoprotein reduced the transcription of PROX1 and
               decreased lymphatic stability. Together these data indicate that
               LECs are active participants in the liver, expanding in an
               attempt to maintain tissue homeostasis. However, when
               inflammatory signals, such as oxidized low density lipoprotein
               are increased, as in NASH, lymphatic function declines and liver
               homeostasis is impeded.</p>

      <p>Many lung diseases result from a failure of efficient
               regeneration of damaged alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) after
               lung injury. During regeneration, AEC2s proliferate to replace
               lost cells, after which proliferation halts and some AEC2s
               transdifferentiate into AEC1s to restore normal alveolar
               structure and function. Although the mechanisms underlying AEC2
               proliferation have been studied, the mechanisms responsible for
               halting proliferation and inducing transdifferentiation are
               poorly understood. To identify candidate signaling pathways
               responsible for halting proliferation and inducing
               transdifferentiation, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on
               AEC2s during regeneration in a murine model of lung injury
               induced by intratracheal LPS. Unsupervised clustering revealed
               distinct subpopulations of regenerating AEC2s: proliferating,
               cell cycle arrest, and transdifferentiating. Gene expression
               analysis of these transitional subpopulations revealed that
               TGF$\beta$ signaling was highly upregulated in the cell cycle
               arrest subpopulation and relatively downregulated in
               transdifferentiating cells. In cultured AEC2s, TGF$\beta$ was
               necessary for cell cycle arrest but impeded
               transdifferentiation. We conclude that during regeneration after
               LPS-induced lung injury, TGF$\beta$ is a critical signal halting
               AEC2 proliferation but must be inactivated to allow
               transdifferentiation. This study provides insight into the
               molecular mechanisms regulating alveolar regeneration and the
               pathogenesis of diseases resulting from a failure of
               regeneration.</p>

      <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse
               gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a
               single experiment. The information in these profiles is
               sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression
               patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries often
               prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual
               cells. To extract more focused gene expression information from
               scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically
               recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets,
               enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by
               another round of DNA sequencing. We applied the method in
               cell-centric and gene-centric modes to isolate cDNA fragments
               from scRNA-seq libraries. First, we resampled the transcriptomes
               of rare, single megakaryocytes from a complex mixture of
               lymphocytes and analyzed them in a second round of DNA
               sequencing, yielding up to 20-fold greater sequencing depth per
               cell and increasing the number of genes detected per cell from a
               median of 1313 to 2002. We similarly isolated mRNAs from
               targeted T cells to improve the reconstruction of their
               VDJ-rearranged immune receptor mRNAs. Second, we isolated CD3D
               mRNA fragments expressed across cells in a scRNA-seq library
               prepared from a clonal T cell line, increasing the number of
               cells with detected CD3D expression from 59.7\% to 100\%.
               Transcriptome resampling is a general approach to recover
               targeted gene expression information from single-cell RNA
               sequencing libraries that enhances the utility of these costly
               experiments, and may be applicable to the targeted recovery of
               molecules from other single-cell assays.</p>

      <p>In the unfolded protein response (UPR), stress in the
               endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates a large transcriptional
               program to increase ER folding capacity. During the budding
               yeast UPR, Ire1 excises an intron from the HAC1 mRNA and the
               exon products of cleavage are ligated, and the translated
               protein induces hundreds of stress-response genes. Using cells
               with mutations in RNA repair and decay enzymes, we show that
               phosphorylation of two different HAC1 splicing intermediates is
               required for their degradation by the 5'$\rightarrow$3'
               exonuclease Xrn1 to enact opposing effects on the UPR. We also
               found that ligated but 2'-phosphorylated HAC1 mRNA is cleaved,
               yielding a decay intermediate with both 5'- and 2'-phosphates at
               its 5'-end that inhibit 5'$\rightarrow$3' decay and suggesting
               that Ire1 degrades incompletely processed HAC1. These decay
               events expand the scope of RNA-based regulation in the budding
               yeast UPR and have implications for the control of the metazoan
               UPR.</p>

    <div class="abstract hidden">
      <p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in
              adults. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) drive the initiation and
              perpetuation of AML, are quantifiably associated with worse
              clinical outcomes, and often persist after conventional
              chemotherapy resulting in relapse1-5. In this report, we show
              that treatment of older patients with AML with the B cell
              lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in combination with
              azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is
              superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these
              promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis
              of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax +
              azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
              cycle manifested by decreased $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and
              increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron
              transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed
              inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of
              succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress
              oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and
              selectively targets LSCs. Our findings show for the first time
              that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients
              with AML by disrupting the metabolic machinery driving energy
              metabolism, resulting in promising clinical activity in a patient
              population with historically poor outcomes.</p>

              perpetuation of AML, are quantifiably associated with worse
              clinical outcomes, and often persist after conventional
              chemotherapy resulting in relapse1-5. In this report, we show
              that treatment of older patients with AML with the B cell
              lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in combination with
              azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is
              superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these
              promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis
              of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax +
              azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
              cycle manifested by decreased $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and
              increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron
              transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed
              inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of
              succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress
              oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and
              selectively targets LSCs. Our findings show for the first time
              that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients
              with AML by disrupting the metabolic machinery driving energy
              metabolism, resulting in promising clinical activity in a patient
              population with historically poor outcomes.</p>

      <p>Although Cdc7 protein kinase is important for regulating DNA
              replication in all eukaryotes and is a target for cancer therapy,
              it has never been localized in cells. Recently, a novel molecular
              genomic method used by our laboratory to localize Cdc7 to regions
              of chromosomes. Originally, mutations in the CDC7 gene were found
              in the classic cdc mutant collection of Hartwell et al. (Genetics
              74:267-286, 1973). The CDC7 gene was found to encode a protein
              kinase called DDK that has been studied for many years,
              establishing its precise role in the initiation of DNA
              replication at origins. Recently, clinical studies are underway
              with DDK inhibitors against DDK in cancer patients. However, the
              conundrum is that Cdc7 has never been detected at origins of
              replication even though many studies have suggested it should be
              there. We used ``Calling Card'' system in which DNA binding
              proteins are localized to the genome via retrotransposon
              insertion and deep-sequencing methods. We have shown that Cdc7
              localizes at many regions of the genome and was enriched at
              functional origins of replication. These results are consistent
              with DDK's role in many additional genomic processes including
              mutagenesis, chromatid cohesion, and meiotic recombination. Thus,
              the main conclusion from our studies is that Cdc7 kinase is found
              at many locations in the genome, but is enriched at functional
              origins of replication. Furthermore, we propose that application
              of the Calling Card system to other eukaryotes should be useful
              in identification of functional origins in other eukaryotic
              cells.</p>

      <p>Modification of DNA nucleobases has a profound effect on genome
              function. We developed a method that maps the positions of the
              modified DNA nucleobases throughout genomic DNA. This method
              couples in vitro nucleobase excision with massively parallel DNA
              sequencing to determine the location of modified DNA nucleobases
              with single base precision. This protocol was used to map uracil
              incorporation and UV photodimers in DNA, and a modification of
              the protocol has been used to map sparse modification events in
              cells. The Excision-seq protocol is broadly applicable to a
              variety of base modifications for which an excision enzyme is
              available.</p>

      <p>During development in the thymus, invariant natural killer T
              (iNKT) cells commit to one of three major functionally different
              subsets, iNKT1, iNKT2, and iNKT17. Here, we show that T cell
              antigen receptor (TCR) signal strength governs the development of
              iNKT cell subsets, with strong signaling promoting iNKT2 and
              iNKT17 development. Altering TCR diversity or signaling
              diminishes iNKT2 and iNKT17 cell subset development in a
              cell-intrinsic manner. Decreased TCR signaling affects the
              persistence of Egr2 expression and the upregulation of PLZF. By
              genome-wide comparison of chromatin accessibility, we identify a
              subset of iNKT2-specific regulatory elements containing NFAT and
              Egr binding motifs that is less accessible in iNKT2 cells that
              develop from reduced TCR signaling. These data suggest that
              variable TCR signaling modulates regulatory element activity at
              NFAT and Egr binding sites exerting a determinative influence on
              the dynamics of gene enhancer accessibility and the developmental
              fate of iNKT cells.</p>

      <p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in
              adults. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) drive the initiation and
              perpetuation of AML, are quantifiably associated with worse
              clinical outcomes, and often persist after conventional
              chemotherapy resulting in relapse1-5. In this report, we show
              that treatment of older patients with AML with the B cell
              lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in combination with
              azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is
              superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these
              promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis
              of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax +
              azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
              cycle manifested by decreased $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and
              increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron
              transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed
              inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of
              succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress
              oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and
              selectively targets LSCs. Our findings show for the first time
              that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients
              with AML by disrupting the metabolic machinery driving energy
              metabolism, resulting in promising clinical activity in a patient
              population with historically poor outcomes.</p>

      <p>RNA editing diversifies genomically encoded information to
               expand the complexity of the transcriptome. In ectothermic
               organisms, including Drosophila and Cephalopoda, where body
               temperature mirrors ambient temperature, decreases in
               environmental temperature lead to increases in A-to-I RNA
               editing and cause amino acid recoding events that are thought to
               be adaptive responses to temperature fluctuations. In contrast,
               endothermic mammals, including humans and mice, typically
               maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental
               changes. Here, A-to-I editing primarily targets repeat elements,
               rarely results in the recoding of amino acids, and plays a
               critical role in innate immune tolerance. Hibernating ground
               squirrels provide a unique opportunity to examine RNA editing in
               a heterothermic mammal whose body temperature varies over 30C
               and can be maintained at 5C for many days during torpor. We
               profiled the transcriptome in three brain regions at six
               physiological states to quantify RNA editing and determine
               whether cold-induced RNA editing modifies the transcriptome as a
               potential mechanism for neuroprotection at low temperature
               during hibernation. We identified 5165 A-to-I editing sites in
               1205 genes with dynamically increased editing after prolonged
               cold exposure. The majority (99.6\%) of the cold-increased
               editing sites are outside of previously annotated coding
               regions, 82.7\% lie in SINE-derived repeats, and 12 sites are
               predicted to recode amino acids. Additionally, A-to-I editing
               frequencies increase with increasing cold-exposure,
               demonstrating that ADAR remains active during torpor. Our
               findings suggest that dynamic A-to-I editing at low body
               temperature may provide a neuroprotective mechanism to limit
               aberrant dsRNA accumulation during torpor in the mammalian
               hibernator.</p>

      <p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia
               in adults. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) drive the initiation and
               perpetuation of AML, are quantifiably associated with worse
               clinical outcomes, and often persist after conventional
               chemotherapy resulting in relapse1-5. In this report, we show
               that treatment of older patients with AML with the B cell
               lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in combination with
               azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is
               superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these
               promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis
               of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax +
               azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
               cycle manifested by decreased $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and
               increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron
               transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed
               inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of
               succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress
               oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and
               selectively targets LSCs. Our findings show for the first time
               that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients
               with AML by disrupting the metabolic machinery driving energy
               metabolism, resulting in promising clinical activity in a
               patient population with historically poor outcomes.</p>

      <p>During development in the thymus, invariant natural killer T
              (iNKT) cells commit to one of three major functionally different
              subsets, iNKT1, iNKT2, and iNKT17. Here, we show that T cell
              antigen receptor (TCR) signal strength governs the development of
              iNKT cell subsets, with strong signaling promoting iNKT2 and
              iNKT17 development. Altering TCR diversity or signaling
              diminishes iNKT2 and iNKT17 cell subset development in a
              cell-intrinsic manner. Decreased TCR signaling affects the
              persistence of Egr2 expression and the upregulation of PLZF. By
              genome-wide comparison of chromatin accessibility, we identify a
              subset of iNKT2-specific regulatory elements containing NFAT and
              Egr binding motifs that is less accessible in iNKT2 cells that
              develop from reduced TCR signaling. These data suggest that
              variable TCR signaling modulates regulatory element activity at
              NFAT and Egr binding sites exerting a determinative influence on
              the dynamics of gene enhancer accessibility and the developmental
              fate of iNKT cells.</p>

      <p>RNA repair enzymes catalyze rejoining of an RNA molecule after
              cleavage of phosphodiester linkages. RNA repair in budding yeast
              is catalyzed by two separate enzymes that process tRNA exons
              during their splicing andHAC1mRNA exons during activation of the
              unfolded protein response (UPR). The RNA ligase Trl1 joins
              2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl RNA fragments, creating a
              phosphodiester linkage with a 2'-phosphate at the junction. The
              2'-phosphate is removed by the 2'-phosphotransferase Tpt1. We
              bypassed the essential functions ofTRL1andTPT1in budding yeast by
              expressing ``prespliced,'' intronless versions of the 10 normally
              intron-containing tRNAs, indicating this repair pathway does not
              have additional essential functions. Consistent with previous
              studies, expression of intronless tRNAs failed to rescue the
              growth of cells with deletions in components of the SEN complex,
              implying an additional essential role for the splicing
              endonuclease. Thetrl1$\Delta$ andtpt1$\Delta$ mutants accumulate
              tRNA andHAC1splicing intermediates indicative of RNA repair
              defects and are hypersensitive to drugs that inhibit translation.
              Failure to induce the unfolded protein response intrl1$\Delta$
              cells grown with tunicamycin is lethal owing to their inability
              to ligateHAC1after its cleavage by Ire1. In contrast,tpt1$\Delta$
              mutants grow in the presence of tunicamycin despite reduced
              accumulation of splicedHAC1mRNA. We optimized a PCR-based method
              to detect RNA 2'-phosphate modifications and show they are
              present on ligatedHAC1mRNA. These RNA repair mutants enable new
              studies of the role of RNA repair in cellular physiology.</p>

      <p>DDK, a conserved serine-threonine protein kinase composed of a
              regulatory subunit, Dbf4, and a catalytic subunit, Cdc7, is
              essential for DNA replication initiation during S phase of the
              cell cycle through MCM2-7 helicase phosphorylation. The
              biological significance of DDK is well characterized, but the
              full mechanism of how DDK associates with substrates remains
              unclear. Cdc7 is bound to chromatin in the Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae genome throughout the cell cycle, but there is little
              empirical evidence as to specific Cdc7 binding locations. Using
              biochemical and genetic techniques, this study investigated the
              specific localization of Cdc7 on chromatin. The Calling Cards
              method, using Ty5 retrotransposons as a marker for DNA-protein
              binding, suggests Cdc7 kinase is preferentially bound to genomic
              DNA known to replicate early in S phase, including centromeres
              and origins of replication. We also discovered Cdc7 binding
              throughout the genome, which may be necessary to initiate other
              cellular processes, including meiotic recombination and
              translesion synthesis. A kinase dead Cdc7 point mutation
              increases the Ty5 retrotransposon integration efficiency and a
              55-amino acid C-terminal truncation of Cdc7, unable to bind Dbf4,
              reduces Cdc7 binding suggesting a requirement for Dbf4 to
              stabilize Cdc7 on chromatin during S phase. Chromatin
              immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Cdc7 binding near specific
              origins changes during S phase. Our results suggest a model where
              Cdc7 is loosely bound to chromatin during G1 At the G1/S
              transition, Cdc7 binding to chromatin is increased and
              stabilized, preferentially at sites that may become origins, in
              order to carry out a variety of cellular processes.</p>

      <p>Disruption of posttranscriptional gene regulation is a critical
              step in oncogenesis that can be difficult to observe using
              traditional molecular techniques. To overcome this limitation, a
              modified polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) protocol was
              used to generate a genome-wide map of alternative polyadenylation
              (APA) events in human primary breast tumor specimens and matched
              normal tissue. This approach identified an APA event in the
              PRELID1 mRNA that enhances its steady-state level and
              translational efficiency, and is a strong breast cancer
              subtype-dependent predictor of patient clinical outcomes.
              Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that PRELID1 regulates
              stress response and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
              production in a cell type-specific manner. Modulation of PRELID1
              expression, including its posttranscriptional control, appears to
              be a common stress response across different cancer types. These
              data reveal that PRELID1 mRNA processing is an important
              regulator of cell type-specific responses to stress used by
              multiple cancers and is associated with patient
              outcomes.Implications: This study suggests that the regulation of
              PRELID1 expression, by APA and other mechanisms, plays a role in
              mitochondrial ROS signaling and represents a novel prognostic
              factor and therapeutic target in cancer. Mol Cancer Res; 15(12);

      <p>New tools for reproducible exploratory data analysis of large
               datasets are important to address the rising size and complexity
               of genomic data. We developed the valr R package to enable
               flexible and efficient genomic interval analysis. valr leverages
               new tools available in the ``tidyverse'', including dplyr.
               Benchmarks of valr show it performs similar to BEDtools and can
               be used for interactive analyses and incorporated into existing
               analysis pipelines.</p>

      <p>BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by
              crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) allows for high
              resolution, genome-wide mapping of RNA-binding proteins. This
              methodology is frequently used to validate predicted targets of
              microRNA binding, as well as direct targets of other RNA-binding
              proteins. Hence, the accuracy and sensitivity of binding site
              identification is critical. RESULTS: We found that substantial
              mispriming during reverse transcription results in the
              overrepresentation of sequences complementary to the primer used
              for reverse transcription. Up to 45 \% of peaks in publicly
              available HITS-CLIP libraries are attributable to this mispriming
              artifact, and the majority of libraries have detectable levels of
              mispriming. We also found that standard techniques for validating
              microRNA-target interactions fail to differentiate between
              artifactual peaks and physiologically relevant peaks.
              CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present a modification to the HITS-CLIP
              protocol that effectively eliminates this artifact and improves
              the sensitivity and complexity of resulting libraries.</p>

      <p>We report that a major subpopulation of monocyte-derived
              macrophages (MDMs) contains high levels of dUTP, which is
              incorporated into HIV-1 DNA during reverse transcription (U/A
              pairs), resulting in pre-integration restriction and
              post-integration mutagenesis. After entering the nucleus,
              uracilated viral DNA products are degraded by the uracil base
              excision repair (UBER) machinery with less than 1\% of the
              uracilated DNA successfully integrating. Although uracilated
              proviral DNA showed few mutations, the viral genomic RNA was
              highly mutated, suggesting that errors occur during
              transcription. Viral DNA isolated from blood monocytes and
              alveolar macrophages (but not T cells) of drug-suppressed
              HIV-infected individuals also contained abundant uracils. The
              presence of viral uracils in short-lived monocytes suggests their
              recent infection through contact with virus producing cells in a
              tissue reservoir. These findings reveal new elements of a viral
              defense mechanism involving host UBER that may be relevant to the
              establishment and persistence of HIV-1 infection.</p>

      <p>The brain plays a critical yet incompletely understood role in
              regulating organismal fat. We performed a neuronal silencing
              screen in Drosophila larvae to identify brain regions required to
              maintain proper levels of organismal fat. When used to modulate
              synaptic activity in specific brain regions, the enhancer-trap
              driver line E347 elevated fat upon neuronal silencing, and
              decreased fat upon neuronal activation. Unbiased sequencing
              revealed that Arc1 mRNA levels increase upon E347 activation. We
              had previously identified Arc1 mutations in a high-fat screen.
              Here we reveal metabolic changes in Arc1 mutants consistent with
              a high-fat phenotype and an overall shift toward energy storage.
              We find that Arc1-expressing cells neighbor E347 neurons, and
              manipulating E347 synaptic activity alters Arc1 expression
              patterns. Elevating Arc1 expression in these cells decreased fat,
              a phenocopy of E347 activation. Finally, loss of Arc1 prevented
              the lean phenotype caused by E347 activation, suggesting that
              Arc1 activity is required for E347 control of body fat.
              Importantly, neither E347 nor Arc1 manipulation altered
              energy-related behaviors. Our results support a model wherein
              E347 neurons induce Arc1 in specific neighboring cells to prevent
              excess fat accumulation.</p>

      <p>During hibernation, animals cycle between torpor and arousal.
              These cycles involve dramatic but poorly understood mechanisms of
              dynamic physiological regulation at the level of gene expression.
              Each cycle, Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) drives periodic arousal
              from torpor by generating essential heat. We applied digital
              transcriptome analysis to precisely timed samples to identify
              molecular pathways that underlie the intense activity cycles of
              hibernator BAT. A cohort of transcripts increased during torpor,
              paradoxical because transcription effectively ceases at these low
              temperatures. We show that this increase occurs not by elevated
              transcription but rather by enhanced stabilization associated
              with maintenance and/or extension of long poly(A) tails.
              Mathematical modeling further supports a temperature-sensitive
              mechanism to protect a subset of transcripts from ongoing bulk
              degradation instead of increased transcription. This subset was
              enriched in a C-rich motif and genes required for BAT activation,
              suggesting a model and mechanism to prioritize translation of key
              proteins for thermogenesis.</p>

      <p>UNLABELLED: Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are influenced by
               type 1 interferon-mediated antiviral defenses and by viral
               countermeasures to these defenses. When IAV NS1 protein is
               disabled, RNase L restricts virus replication; however, the RNAs
               targeted for cleavage by RNase L under these conditions have not
               been defined. In this study, we used deep-sequencing methods to
               identify RNase L cleavage sites within host and viral RNAs from
               IAV PR8$\Delta$NS1-infected A549 cells. Short hairpin RNA
               knockdown of RNase L allowed us to distinguish between RNase
               L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites. RNase
               L-dependent cleavage sites were evident at discrete locations in
               IAV RNA segments (both positive and negative strands). Cleavage
               in PB2, PB1, and PA genomic RNAs suggests that viral RNPs are
               susceptible to cleavage by RNase L. Prominent amounts of
               cleavage mapped to specific regions within IAV RNAs, including
               some areas of increased synonymous-site conservation. Among
               cellular RNAs, RNase L-dependent cleavage was most frequent at
               precise locations in rRNAs. Our data show that RNase L targets
               specific sites in both host and viral RNAs to restrict influenza
               virus replication when NS1 protein is disabled. IMPORTANCE:
               RNase L is a critical component of interferon-regulated and
               double-stranded-RNA-activated antiviral host responses. We
               sought to determine how RNase L exerts its antiviral activity
               during influenza virus infection. We enhanced the antiviral
               activity of RNase L by disabling a viral protein, NS1, that
               inhibits the activation of RNase L. Then, using deep-sequencing
               methods, we identified the host and viral RNAs targeted by RNase
               L. We found that RNase L cleaved viral RNAs and rRNAs at very
               precise locations. The direct cleavage of IAV RNAs by RNase L
               highlights an intimate battle between viral RNAs and an
               antiviral endonuclease.</p>

      <p>RNA cleavage by some endoribonucleases and self-cleaving
              ribozymes produces RNA fragments with 5'-hydroxyl (5'-OH) and
              2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini. To identify 5'-OH RNA fragments
              produced by these cleavage events, we exploited the unique
              ligation mechanism of Escherichia coli RtcB RNA ligase to attach
              an oligonucleotide linker to RNAs with 5'-OH termini, followed by
              steps for library construction and analysis by massively parallel
              DNA sequencing. We applied the method to RNA from budding yeast
              and captured known 5'-OH fragments produced by tRNA Splicing
              Endonuclease (SEN) during processing of intron-containing
              pre-tRNAs and by Ire1 cleavage of HAC1 mRNA following induction
              of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We identified numerous
              novel 5'-OH fragments derived from mRNAs: some 5'-OH mRNA
              fragments were derived from single, localized cleavages, while
              others were likely produced by multiple, distributed cleavages.
              Many 5'-OH fragments derived from mRNAs were produced upstream of
              codons for highly electrostatic peptides, suggesting that the
              fragments may be generated by co-translational mRNA decay.
              Several 5'-OH RNA fragments accumulated during the induction of
              the UPR, some of which share a common sequence motif that may
              direct cleavage of these mRNAs. This method enables specific
              capture of 5'-OH termini and complements existing methods for
              identifying RNAs with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini.</p>

      <p>Abundant ribonucleotide incorporation in DNA during replication
              and repair has profound consequences for genome stability, but
              the global distribution of ribonucleotide incorporation is
              unknown. We developed ribose-seq, a method for capturing unique
              products generated by alkaline cleavage of DNA at embedded
              ribonucleotides. High-throughput sequencing of these fragments in
              DNA from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed widespread
              ribonucleotide distribution, with a strong preference for
              cytidine and guanosine, and identified hotspots of ribonucleotide
              incorporation in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Ribonucleotides
              were primarily incorporated on the newly synthesized leading

      <p>RNA cleavage by some endoribonucleases and self-cleaving
              ribozymes produces RNA fragments with 5'-hydroxyl (5'-OH) and
              2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini. To identify 5'-OH RNA fragments
              produced by these cleavage events, we exploited the unique
              ligation mechanism of Escherichia coli RtcB RNA ligase to attach
              an oligonucleotide linker to RNAs with 5'-OH termini, followed by
              steps for library construction and analysis by massively parallel
              DNA sequencing. We applied the method to RNA from budding yeast
              and captured known 5'-OH fragments produced by tRNA Splicing
              Endonuclease (SEN) during processing of intron-containing
              pre-tRNAs and by Ire1 cleavage of HAC1 mRNA following induction
              of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We identified numerous
              novel 5'-OH fragments derived from mRNAs: some 5'-OH mRNA
              fragments were derived from single, localized cleavages, while
              others were likely produced by multiple, distributed cleavages.
              Many 5'-OH fragments derived from mRNAs were produced upstream of
              codons for highly electrostatic peptides, suggesting that the
              fragments may be generated by co-translational mRNA decay.
              Several 5'-OH RNA fragments accumulated during the induction of
              the UPR, some of which share a common sequence motif that may
              direct cleavage of these mRNAs. This method enables specific
              capture of 5'-OH termini and complements existing methods for
              identifying RNAs with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini.</p>

      <p>Turnover of the branched RNA intermediates and products of
              pre-mRNA splicing is mediated by the lariat-debranching enzyme
              Dbr1. We characterized a homolog of Dbr1 from Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae, Drn1/Ygr093w, that has a
              pseudo-metallophosphodiesterase domain with primary sequence
              homology to Dbr1 but lacks essential active site residues found
              in Dbr1. Whereas loss of Dbr1 results in lariat-introns failing
              broadly to turnover, loss of Drn1 causes low levels of
              lariat-intron accumulation. Conserved residues in the Drn1
              C-terminal CwfJ domains, which are not present in Dbr1, are
              required for efficient intron turnover. Drn1 interacts with Dbr1,
              components of the Nineteen Complex, U2 snRNA, branched
              intermediates, and products of splicing. Drn1 enhances
              debranching catalyzed by Dbr1 in vitro, but does so without
              significantly improving the affinity of Dbr1 for branched RNA.
              Splicing carried out in in vitro extracts in the absence of Drn1
              results in an accumulation of branched splicing intermediates and
              products released from the spliceosome, likely due to less active
              debranching, as well as the promiscuous release of cleaved
              5'-exon. Drn1 enhances Dbr1-mediated turnover of
              lariat-intermediates and lariat-intron products, indicating that
              branched RNA turnover is regulated at multiple steps during
              splicing.</p>

      <p>The incorporation and creation of modified nucleobases in DNA
              have profound effects on genome function. We describe methods for
              mapping positions and local content of modified DNA nucleobases
              in genomic DNA. We combined in vitro nucleobase excision with
              massively parallel DNA sequencing (Excision-seq) to determine the
              locations of modified nucleobases in genomic DNA. We applied the
              Excision-seq method to map uracil in E. coli and budding yeast
              and discovered significant variation in uracil content, wherein
              uracil is excluded from the earliest and latest replicating
              regions of the genome, possibly driven by changes in nucleotide
              pool composition. We also used Excision-seq to identify sites of
              pyrimidine dimer formation induced by UV light exposure, where
              the method could distinguish between sites of cyclobutane and 6-4
              photoproduct formation. These UV mapping data enabled analysis of
              local sequence bias around pyrimidine dimers and suggested a
              preference for an adenosine downstream from 6-4 photoproducts.
              The Excision-seq method is broadly applicable for high precision,
              genome-wide mapping of modified nucleobases with cognate repair
              enzymes.</p>

      <p>Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is a metal-ion-independent
              endoribonuclease associated with antiviral and antibacterial
              defense, cancer and lifespan. Despite the biological significance
              of RNase L, the RNAs cleaved by this enzyme are poorly defined.
              In this study, we used deep sequencing methods to reveal the
              frequency and location of RNase L cleavage sites within host and
              viral RNAs. To make cDNA libraries, we exploited the 2',
              3'-cyclic phosphate at the end of RNA fragments produced by RNase
              L and other metal-ion-independent endoribonucleases. We optimized
              and validated 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina
              sequencing methods using viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase
              L, viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase A and RNA from
              uninfected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. Using these
              methods, we identified (i) discrete regions of hepatitis C virus
              and poliovirus RNA genomes that were profoundly susceptible to
              RNase L and other single-strand specific endoribonucleases, (ii)
              RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites within
              ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and (iii) 2', 3'-cyclic phosphates at the
              ends of 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA. Monitoring the frequency and
              location of metal-ion-independent endoribonuclease cleavage sites
              within host and viral RNAs reveals, in part, how these enzymes
              contribute to health and disease.</p>

      <p>RNA ligation can regulate RNA function by altering RNA sequence,
              structure and coding potential. For example, the function of XBP1
              in mediating the unfolded protein response requires RNA ligation,
              as does the maturation of some tRNAs. Here, we describe a novel
              in vivo model in Caenorhabditis elegans for the conserved RNA
              ligase RtcB and show that RtcB ligates the xbp-1 mRNA during the
              IRE-1 branch of the unfolded protein response. Without RtcB,
              protein stress results in the accumulation of unligated xbp-1
              mRNA fragments, defects in the unfolded protein response, and
              decreased lifespan. RtcB also ligates endogenous pre-tRNA halves,
              and RtcB mutants have defects in growth and lifespan that can be
              bypassed by expression of pre-spliced tRNAs. In addition, animals
              that lack RtcB have defects that are independent of tRNA
              maturation and the unfolded protein response. Thus, RNA ligation
              by RtcB is required for the function of multiple endogenous
              target RNAs including both xbp-1 and tRNAs. RtcB is uniquely
              capable of performing these ligation functions, and RNA ligation
              by RtcB mediates multiple essential processes in vivo.</p>

      <p>After transcription of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA, its introns are
              removed by the spliceosome, joining exons for translation. The
              intron products of splicing have long been considered 'junk' and
              destined only for destruction. But because they are large in size
              and under weak selection constraints, many introns have been
              evolutionarily repurposed to serve roles after splicing. Some
              spliced introns are precursors for further processing of other
              encoded RNAs such as small nucleolar RNAs, microRNAs, and long
              noncoding RNAs. Other intron products have long half-lives and
              can be exported to the cytoplasm, suggesting that they have roles
              in translation. Some viruses encode introns that accumulate after
              splicing and play important but mysterious roles in viral
              latency. Turnover of most lariat-introns is initiated by cleavage
              of their internal 2'-5' phosphodiester bonds by a unique
              debranching endonuclease, and the linear products are further
              degraded by exoribonucleases. However, several introns appear to
              evade this turnover pathway and the determinants of their
              stability are largely unknown. Whereas many stable intron
              products were discovered serendipitously, new experimental and
              computational tools will enable their direct identification and
              study. Finally, the origins and mechanisms of mobility of
              eukaryotic introns are mysterious, and mechanistic studies of the
              intron life cycle may yield new insights into how they arose and
              became widespread.</p>

              However, current ligation-based RNA capture methods require RNA

              generated by endonucleolytic cleavages and self-cleaving
              ribozymes and are found as stable modifications on cellular RNAs
              such as the U6 spliceosomal RNA. We developed a method that uses

              reads of specific fragments from several tRNA isoacceptor

      <p>The orchestrated binding of transcriptional activators and
              repressors to specific DNA sequences in the context of chromatin
              defines the regulatory program of eukaryotic genomes. We
              developed a digital approach to assay regulatory protein
              occupancy on genomic DNA in vivo by dense mapping of individual
              DNase I cleavages from intact nuclei using massively parallel DNA
              sequencing. Analysis of &gt;23 million cleavages across the
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome revealed thousands of protected
              regulatory protein footprints, enabling de novo derivation of
              factor binding motifs and the identification of hundreds of new
              binding sites for major regulators. We observed striking
              correspondence between single-nucleotide resolution DNase I
              cleavage patterns and protein-DNA interactions determined by
              crystallography. The data also yielded a detailed view of larger
              chromatin features including positioned nucleosomes flanking
              factor binding regions. Digital genomic footprinting should be a
              powerful approach to delineate the cis-regulatory framework of
              any organism with an available genome sequence.</p>

      <p>Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria and
              kills up to 2.7 million people annually. Despite the global
              importance of P. falciparum, the vast majority of its proteins
              have not been characterized experimentally. Here we identify P.
              falciparum protein-protein interactions using a high-throughput
              version of the yeast two-hybrid assay that circumvents the
              difficulties in expressing P. falciparum proteins in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From more than 32,000 yeast two-hybrid
              screens with P. falciparum protein fragments, we identified 2,846
              unique interactions, most of which include at least one
              previously uncharacterized protein. Informatic analyses of
              network connectivity, coexpression of the genes encoding
              interacting fragments, and enrichment of specific protein domains
              or Gene Ontology annotations were used to identify groups of
              interacting proteins, including one implicated in chromatin
              modification, transcription, messenger RNA stability and
              ubiquitination, and another implicated in the invasion of host
              cells. These data constitute the first extensive description of
              the protein interaction network for this important human
              pathogen.</p>

      <p>Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria and
              kills up to 2.7 million people annually. Despite the global
              importance of P. falciparum, the vast majority of its proteins
              have not been characterized experimentally. Here we identify P.
              falciparum protein-protein interactions using a high-throughput
              version of the yeast two-hybrid assay that circumvents the
              difficulties in expressing P. falciparum proteins in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From more than 32,000 yeast two-hybrid
              screens with P. falciparum protein fragments, we identified 2,846
              unique interactions, most of which include at least one
              previously uncharacterized protein. Informatic analyses of
              network connectivity, coexpression of the genes encoding
              interacting fragments, and enrichment of specific protein domains
              or Gene Ontology annotations were used to identify groups of
              interacting proteins, including one implicated in chromatin
              modification, transcription, messenger RNA stability and
              ubiquitination, and another implicated in the invasion of host
              cells. These data constitute the first extensive description of
              the protein interaction network for this important human
              pathogen.</p>

      <p>Allosteric ribozymes (aptazymes) can transduce the noncovalent
              recognition of analytes into the catalytic generation of readily
              observable signals. Aptazymes are easily engineered, can detect
              diverse classes of biologically relevant molecules, and have high
              signal-to-noise ratios. These features make aptazymes useful
              candidates for incorporation into biosensor arrays. Allosteric
              ribozyme ligases that can recognize a variety of analytes ranging
              from small organics to proteins have been generated. Upon
              incorporation into an array format, multiple different aptazyme
              ligases were able to simultaneously detect their cognate analytes
              with high specificity. Analyte concentrations could be accurately
              measured into the nanomolar range. The fact that analytes induced
              the formation of new covalent bonds in aptazyme ligases (as
              opposed to noncovalent bonds in antibodies) potentiated stringent
              washing of the array, leading to improved signal-to-noise ratios
              and limits of detection.</p>

      <p>Reagents for proteome research must of necessity be generated by
              high throughput methods. Aptamers are potentially useful as
              reagents to identify and quantitate individual proteins, yet are
              currently produced for the most part by manual selection
              procedures. We have developed automated selection methods, but
              must still individually purify protein targets. Therefore, we
              have attempted to select aptamers against protein targets
              generated by in vitro transcription and translation of individual
              genes. In order to specifically immobilize the protein targets
              for selection, they are also biotinylated in vitro. As a proof of
              this method, we have selected aptamers against translated human
              U1A, a component of the nuclear spliceosome. Selected sequences
              demonstrated exquisite mimicry of natural binding sequences and
              structures. These results not only reveal a potential path to the
              high throughput generation of aptamers, but also yield insights
              into the incredible specificity of the U1A protein for its
              natural RNA ligands.</p>

      <p>A small ribozyme ligase (L1) selected from a random sequence
              population appears to utilize non-Watson-Crick base pairs at its
              ligation junction. Mutational and selection analyses confirmed
              the presence of these base pairings. Randomization of the L1 core
              and selection of active ligases yielded highly active variants
              whose rates were on the order of 1 min(-1). Base-pairing
              covariations confirmed the general secondary structure of the
              ligase, and the most active ligases contained a novel pentuple
              sequence covariation. The optimized L1 ligases may be optimal
              within their sequence spaces, and minimal ligases that span less
              than 60 nt in length have been engineered based on these results.</p>

      <p>In vitro selection methods have proven to be extraordinarily
              adept at generating a wide variety of nucleic acid-binding
              species (aptamers) and catalysts (ribozymes). To date, selected
              nucleic acids have primarily been of academic interest. However,
              just as antibodies have proven utility as 'universal receptors'
              that can be crafted against a huge variety of ligands and can be
              readily adapted to diagnostic assays, aptamers may yet find
              application in assays. A new class of research reagents,
              aptazymes, are not mere mimics of antibodies but in fact allow
              the direct transduction of molecular recognition to catalysis.
              Aptamers and aptazymes may prove to be uniquely useful for the
              development of chip arrays for the detection and quantitation of
              a wide range of molecules in organismal proteomes and
              metabolomes.</p>

      <p>The cytotoxin ricin disables translation by depurinating a
              conserved site in eukaryotic rRNA. In vitro selection has been
              used to generate RNA ligands (aptamers) specific for the
              catalytic ricin A-chain (RTA). The anti-RTA aptamers bear no
              resemblance to the normal RTA substrate, the sarcin-ricin loop
              (SRL), and were not depurinated by RTA. An initial 80-nucleotide
              RNA ligand was minimized to a 31-nucleotide aptamer that
              contained all sequences and structures necessary for interacting
              with RTA. This minimal RNA formed high affinity complexes with
              RTA (K(d) = 7.3 nM) which could compete directly with the SRL for
              binding to RTA. The aptamer inhibited RTA depurination of the SRL
              and could partially protect translation from RTA inhibition. The
              IC(50) of the aptamer for RTA in an in vitro translation assay is
              100 nM, roughly 3 orders of magnitude lower than a small molecule
              inhibitor of ricin, pteroic acid, and 2 orders of magnitude lower
              than the best known RNA inhibitor. The novel anti-RTA aptamers
              may find application as diagnostic reagents for a potential
              biological warfare agent and hold promise as scaffolds for the
              development of strong ricin inhibitors.</p>
